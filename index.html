Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to diagnose whether or not someone is suffering from a cold, allergies, flu, or COVID-19 through a series of questions to help diagnose. 
 
Known Issues:
The known issues are that allergy, cold, flu, and COVID-19 symptoms are very similar and it is difficult to determine which one that you are suffering from.
